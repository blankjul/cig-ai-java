This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository should improve the teamwork for the eneral Video Game AI Competition - 2014.

### How do I get set up? ###

First of all you have to clone the gvgai project:

cd ~/workspace

git clone https://github.com/EssexUniversityMCTS/gvgai


Then clone our controller :

git clone https://julesy@bitbucket.org/julesy/cig.git

Now you should have two directories: 

~/workspace/gvgai

~/workspace/cig


In order to use our controller you need to create a symbolic link:

ln ~/workspace/cig/src ~/workspace/gvgai/controllers

Create an eclipse project:

File -> New -> Java-Project with the name gvgai.

Now you could start the Test.java. Don't forget to set the correct string!
