\section{Literature Review}

The field of \ac{CIG} is a very large research area and there is a lot of work related to this topic. We are dealing with \ac{GVGP}, which belongs to \ac{CIG}. 
An essential work from T. Schaul~\cite{schaul2013pyvgdl} shows how our game environment is build-up. He describes a \ac{GVGL} in which games can be described in a text file without the knowledge of programming games. Different objects can be created and rules can be defined which decide what happens if one object collides with another. It was created for research in \ac{AI} in games and creating very fast prototypes of General Video Games. The agent which plays the game gets information about the actual state and can chose an available action. In our case, the agent gets a global observation grid and not only a local one (e.g. first-person view). 

There are several conferences which deal with the topic of \ac{CIG} e.g. the IEEE Conference on \ac{CIG} or the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE). The field of \ac{CIG} contains a lot of different research areas beside \ac{GVGP} and agent decision making. Yannakakis, G.N. and Togelius, J. pointed out 10 main research areas of \ac{CIG}: "NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games"~\cite{panorama}.
This shows the variety of this research field. In the topic of \ac{GVGP} often \ac{MCTS} is used. The comprehensive description of methods~\cite{BrowneMCTSurvey} describes nearly all approaches for \ac{GVGP} using \ac{MCTS}. We used this approach to cover the domain of \ac{RL} based algorithms.
