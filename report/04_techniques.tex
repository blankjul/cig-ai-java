\section{Techniques Implemented} \label{sec:exp}

Describe the controllers you created. Explain how they work, in which techniques are they based on (probably from previous section), and include figures and pseudocode as needed.


\subsection{Stay Alive} 

pessimistic iteration

grid search



\subsection{Heuristic based} 
 



\subsection{MCTS Tree} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item act choosig -> most visited node
  \item tree policy
  \item default policy
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Evolutionary algorithm} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item basics mutation score crossover
  \item sliding window
  \item adaptive path length
  \item heuristic switch
  
  
\subsection{Game Detection} 
  
  
\end{itemize}
