\section{Conclusions and Future Work} 
\label{sec:conc}

This paper presents a comparison of several approach to play general video games. We selected for each research area (\ac{HR}, \ac{RL}, \ac{NI})
one algorithm and implemented that. 


For the evaluation we forced to look at the data for example average wins, score and time steps.
We ignored the in-game behaviour of our agents completely and only looked at the statistics. 
Furthermore we were limited by time and computational power which restricts the iterations of our experiment. 
To get more significant results experimental setup with more than 1000 iterations would stand for an higher validity.
